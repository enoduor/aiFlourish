A \"cron job\" is a command or script that is scheduled to run automatically at a certain time or interval. The cron daemon reads a configuration file called crontab, which contains a list of scheduled tasks for each user. Cron is commonly used for system maintenance tasks, such as backing up files, cleaning up temporary files, updating software packages, or sending reports. It can also be used to run custom scripts or applications that need to be executed at specific intervals. However, users need to have some knowledge of Unix commands and shell scripting to use cron effectively and avoid conflicts or system overload.", "tutorial_tool": "To use Cron, you need to create a Cron job. A Cron job is a script or command that you want to run at a specific time or interval. Here's how to create a Cron job:\r\n1. Open your terminal and type the following command to edit your Cron file:\r\nBash\r\ncrontab -e\r\n\r\n2. This will open the Cron file in your default text editor. The Cron file contains a list of scheduled jobs that are executed by Cron.\r\n3. To create a new Cron job, add a new line to the file in the following format:\r\nbash\r\n* * * * * command\r\n\r\nThe * symbols represent the time and date fields, which determine when the job will run. The command is the script or command that you want to run.\r\nThe time and date fields are as follows:\r\nscss\r\n* * * * *\r\n| | | | |\r\n| | | | ----- Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday is both 0 and 7)\r\n| | | ------- Month (1 - 12)\r\n| | --------- Day of the month (1 - 31)\r\n| ----------- Hour (0 - 23)\r\n------------- Minute (0 - 59)\r\n\r\n4. For example, if you want to run a script every day at 2:30 AM, you would use the following Cron job:\r\nbash\r\n30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh\r\nThis Cron job runs the script.sh script every day at 2:30 AM.\r\n5. Once you've added your new Cron job, save the file and exit the editor.\r\n6. You can verify that your Cron job has been added by running the following command:\r\nbash\r\ncrontab -l\r\nThis will list all the Cron jobs that are scheduled on your system.\r\nThat's it! Your new Cron job will now run at the specified time and interval. You can create as many Cron jobs as you need, and you can modify or delete existing Cron jobs by editing the Cron file with the crontab -e command.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the tutorial on Cron, here are a few additional tips and best practices for using Cron effectively:\r\nTest your Cron jobs: Before setting up a new Cron job, test the script or command to make sure it works as expected. You can run the command manually from the command line to test it.\r\nUse absolute paths: When specifying the script or command in your Cron job, use absolute paths instead of relative paths. This ensures that the Cron job runs correctly, regardless of the current working directory.\r\nRedirect output: By default, the output of a Cron job is sent to the system log file. To redirect the output to a specific file, use the > operator. For example, 30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh > /path/to/log.txt redirects the output of the script to log.txt.\r\nDon't assume environment variables are set: Cron jobs run in a limited environment, and some environment variables may not be set by default. If your script or command depends on environment variables, set them explicitly in your Cron job.\r\nUse a unique identifier: When creating a Cron job, use a unique identifier in the comment field to make it easier to identify and manage later. For example, 30 2 * * * /path/to/script.sh # Backup Job identifies the Cron job as a backup job.\r\nRegularly review and maintain Cron jobs: Over time, your system may accumulate many Cron jobs, some of which may no longer be needed. Regularly review and maintain your Cron jobs to ensure that they are still relevant and necessary.\r\nBy following these best practices, you can effectively use Cron to automate recurring tasks and streamline your system management.", "ad": "A cron job, or simply cron, is a scheduling utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows users to execute commands or scripts automatically at specified intervals. It is commonly used to automate system maintenance tasks, backup operations, and other routine processes.\r\nIf you're looking to advertise a product or service related to cron, you may want to target system administrators, DevOps engineers, or software developers who use Unix-like systems. You could advertise through online forums or websites that cater to these audiences, such as StackOverflow, Reddit, or GitHub. You could also consider running targeted ads on search engines like Google or social media platforms like LinkedIn.\r\nWhen creating your ad, make sure to highlight the benefits of your product or service and how it can help streamline and automate tasks for users who work with cron.

It is a high-level, interpreted language, meaning it is designed to be easy to read and write, and code is executed by an interpreter rather than being compiled into machine code.\r\n\r\nJavaScript can be used on both the front-end and back-end of web development, and is supported by all major web browsers. It is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.\r\n\r\nSome of the key features of JavaScript include its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page, which allows developers to dynamically change the content and style of a page based on user input or other events. JavaScript also supports functions, which allow developers to organize and reuse code, and supports a wide range of data types, including strings, numbers, and objects.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is constantly evolving, with new features and functionality being added to the language on a regular basis. It has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development and share knowledge through online forums, tutorials, and other resources.", "tutorial_tool": "1. Understand the basics of Javascript: Before diving into writing Javascript code, it's important to understand the basics of the language. Javascript is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for web development, server-side scripting, and automation. It is used to create interactive web applications and is compatible with multiple platforms.\r\n\r\n2. Choose a text editor: You'll need a text editor to write your Javascript code. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom. Choose one that you find comfortable to work with.\r\n\r\n3. Create an HTML file: Javascript is typically used in conjunction with HTML and CSS. To get started, create a new HTML file and save it with the .html extension.\r\n\r\n4. Add a script tag: Inside the HTML file, add a script tag where you can write your Javascript code. The script tag should look like this:\r\n\r\nhtml\r\nCopy code\r\n<script>\r\n// your Javascript code goes here\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n5. Write your first program: Let's start with a simple program that outputs a message to the console. Type the following code between the script tags:\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello, world!\");\r\n\r\n6. Run your program: Save the HTML file and open it in your web browser. Open the browser's developer console (usually accessible by pressing F12) and you should see \"Hello, world!\" printed in the console.\r\n\r\n7. Declare variables: Variables are used to store data in Javascript. To declare a variable, use the var keyword, followed by the variable name and the initial value. For example:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nvar message = \"Hello, world!\";\r\nconsole.log(message);\r\n\r\n8. Use conditional statements: Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The if statement is a common example. Here's an example:\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nvar age = 18;\r\n\r\nif (age >= 18) {\r\n  console.log(\"You are an adult.\");\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(\"You are not an adult yet.\");\r\n}\r\n\r\n9. Use loops: Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times. The for loop is a common example. Here's an example:\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfor (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {\r\n  console.log(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\n10. Use functions: Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that can be called multiple times. Here's an example:\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfunction greet(name) {\r\n  console.log(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\ngreet(\"John\");\r\n\r\nThis should give you a good starting point for learning Javascript.

The website has a clean and simple interface that makes it easy to navigate.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Search for a property or selector\r\nCSSReference offers two search options: \"Search properties\" and \"Search selectors.\" If you're looking for information on a CSS property, click on \"Search properties\" and enter the name of the property in the search bar. If you're looking for information on a CSS selector, click on \"Search selectors\" and enter the name of the selector.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Explore the documentation\r\nOnce you've entered your search term, CSSReference will take you to the documentation page for the property or selector you searched for. The page will include a detailed description of the property or selector, its syntax, possible values, and examples of how to use it in your CSS code.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Navigate the page\r\nThe documentation page for a CSS property or selector can be quite long, so it's important to know how to navigate it. You can use the table of contents on the left-hand side of the page to jump to different sections of the documentation. You can also use the \"Previous\" and \"Next\" buttons at the bottom of the page to move back and forth between different properties or selectors.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Copy and paste code examples\r\nOne of the most useful features of CSSReference is the code examples that are provided for each property or selector. You can copy and paste these examples directly into your own CSS code, which can save you time and effort.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Use the interactive examples\r\nSome properties and selectors on CSSReference come with interactive examples that allow you to see the effect of different property values in real-time. These examples can be a great way to experiment with different CSS styles and learn how they work.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Bookmark frequently used pages\r\nIf you find yourself referring to the same CSS properties or selectors frequently, you may want to bookmark those pages for easy access. To do this, simply click on the \"Bookmark\" button at the top of the page. You can then access your bookmarks by clicking on the \"Bookmarks\" button in the top-right corner of the page.\r\n\r\nThat's it!

The organization also encourages collaboration and community building through hackathons, workshops, and forums where users can share their insights and applications.", "tutorial_tool": "1. First, you need to understand what Common Crawl is. Common Crawl is a non-profit organization that provides a free and open repository of web crawl data. They have been crawling the web since 2008 and have collected billions of web pages.\r\n\r\n2. Go to the Common Crawl website at https://commoncrawl.org/. Here, you can access the data they have collected and download it for your own use.\r\n\r\n3. To download the data, you can use one of their provided Amazon S3 buckets. These buckets are organized by year and month, and each bucket contains several files that represent different parts of the crawl.\r\n\r\n4. You can access the data using a web browser or a command-line tool like AWS CLI. If you're using a web browser, you can simply navigate to the appropriate bucket and download the files you need. If you're using AWS CLI, you can use the \"aws s3\" command to download the files.\r\n\r\n5. Once you have the data downloaded, you'll need to extract the information you need from the files. Common Crawl data is stored in a format called WARC (Web ARChive). You'll need to use a tool that can read and extract data from WARC files.\r\n\r\n6. One popular tool for working with WARC files is called \"warcio\". This is a Python library that can be used to read and extract data from WARC files.\r\n\r\n7. To use warcio, you'll first need to install it. You can do this using pip, the Python package manager. Run the following command to install warcio:\r\n\r\npip install warcio\r\n\r\n8. Once you have warcio installed, you can use it to extract data from the WARC files you downloaded from Common Crawl. For example, you can extract all the links from a WARC file using the following code:\r\n\r\npython\r\nCopy code\r\nfrom warcio.archiveiterator import ArchiveIterator\r\n\r\nwith open('path/to/warc/file', 'rb') as stream:\r\n    for record in ArchiveIterator(stream):\r\n        if record.rec_type == 'response':\r\n            content_type = record.http_headers.get('Content-Type', '').lower()\r\n            if 'html' in content_type:\r\n                html = record.content_stream().read().decode('utf-8', 'replace')\r\n                # use an HTML parser like BeautifulSoup to extract the links\r\n\r\n9.

You can check if the REST API is enabled by visiting http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/ in your web browser. If you see a list of posts or pages, then the REST API is working.\r\n\r\n3. To access the WordPress API, you need an authentication method. There are several authentication methods available in the WordPress API, including Basic Authentication, OAuth, and JWT. For this tutorial, we'll be using Basic Authentication. To use Basic Authentication, you need to install and activate the Basic Authentication plugin.\r\n\r\n4. Once the Basic Authentication plugin is activated, you can authenticate with the WordPress API by sending an HTTP request with your username and password in the Authorization header. You can use any HTTP client to make requests to the API, such as cURL, Postman, or the fetch API in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n5. Now that you're authenticated, you can start making requests to the WordPress API. The WordPress API has several endpoints for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting posts, pages, comments, and users. You can find a list of all the available endpoints in the WordPress API documentation.\r\n\r\n6. To retrieve a post using the WordPress API, you can send a GET request to the /wp/v2/posts/{id} endpoint, where {id} is the ID of the post you want to retrieve. For example, to retrieve the post with ID 123, you can send a GET request to http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123/.\r\n\r\n7. To create a new post using the WordPress API, you can send a POST request to the /wp/v2/posts endpoint with the post data in the request body. The post data should be in JSON format and include the title, content, and any other fields you want to set. For example, to create a new post with the title \"My New Post\" and the content \"Hello, world!\", you can send a POST request to http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/ with the following JSON data:\r\n\r\njson\r\nCopy code\r\n{\r\n    \"title\": \"My New Post\",\r\n    \"content\": \"Hello, world!\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n8. To update an existing post using the WordPress API, you can send a PUT request to the /wp/v2/posts/{id} endpoint with the updated post data in the request body. For example, to update the post with ID 123 with the title \"My Updated Post\" and the content \"Hello, universe!\", you can send a PUT request to http://yoursite.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123/ with the following JSON data:\r\njson\r\nCopy code\r\n{\r\n    \"title\": \"My Updated Post\",\r\n    \"content\": \"Hello, universe!\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n9. To delete an existing post using the WordPress API, you can send a DELETE request to the /wp/v2/posts/{id} endpoint.

Additionally, Stencil's virtual DOM system optimizes rendering performance, improving the speed and efficiency of web applications.", "tutorial_tool": "Prerequisites\r\nBefore we begin, you'll need to have the following software installed on your computer:\r\n\r\nNode.js (version 10 or later)\r\nnpm (version 6 or later)\r\nYou can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org\r\n\r\nStep 1: Install Stencil\r\nTo install Stencil, open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command:\r\n\r\nbash\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm install -g @stencil/core\r\nThis will install the Stencil command line interface (CLI) globally on your computer.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Create a new Stencil project\r\nNext, create a new Stencil project by running the following command:\r\n\r\ncsharp\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm init stencil\r\nThis command will prompt you for some information about your project, such as the project name and description. You can leave the default options for most of the prompts.\r\n\r\nAfter you've answered all the prompts, Stencil will create a new project folder with the name you specified. Change into the project directory by running:\r\n\r\nbash\r\nCopy code\r\ncd <project-name>\r\nStep 3: Create a new Stencil component\r\nNow it's time to create a new Stencil component. Run the following command to generate a new component:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm run generate\r\nThis will open a prompt where you can enter the name of your component. For this tutorial, let's call it \"my-component\".\r\n\r\nAfter you've entered the component name, Stencil will create a new folder called \"my-component\" with the following files:\r\n\r\nmy-component.tsx: the TypeScript file where you'll define your component\r\nmy-component.css: the CSS file where you'll style your component\r\nmy-component.spec.ts: a test file for your component\r\nStep 4: Define your Stencil component\r\nOpen the my-component.tsx file in your code editor and replace the contents with the following code:\r\n\r\ntsx\r\nCopy code\r\nimport { Component, h } from '@stencil/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  tag: 'my-component',\r\n  styleUrl: 'my-component.css',\r\n  shadow: true,\r\n})\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <p>Hello, World!</p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nThis code defines a new Stencil component called \"my-component\" that displays the text \"Hello, World!\". The tag property specifies the custom element name that will be used to display the component in HTML. The styleUrl property points to the CSS file that will be used to style the component. The shadow property tells Stencil to create a shadow DOM for the component.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Style your Stencil component\r\nOpen the my-component.css file and add the following CSS:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\np {\r\n  color: red;\r\n}\r\nThis will set the color of the text inside the <p> element to red.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Build your Stencil component\r\nBefore you can use your Stencil component in a web page, you need to build it. Run the following command to build the component:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm run build\r\nThis will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript and create a bundle that can be used in a web page.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Use your Stencil component in a web page\r\nTo use your Stencil component in a web page, create a new HTML file and add the following code:\r\n\r\nhtml\r\nCopy code\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Liz8-o5kjI"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 244, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "PicMonkey", "description": "PicMonkey is an online photo editing and design platform that allows users to edit and enhance images, create graphics, and design collages.

It is the backbone of the World Wide Web and is used to define the structure and content of a webpage.\r\n\r\nHTML is made up of a series of tags, which are enclosed in angled brackets. These tags are used to define the different parts of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, lists, tables, and forms. Each tag has a specific purpose and can be used to add various elements to a webpage.\r\n\r\nHTML also allows web developers to include multimedia content such as videos, audio files, and animations. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, has introduced many new features such as semantic elements, which provide a more meaningful way to define the structure of a webpage, and canvas and SVG elements, which enable the creation of complex graphics and animations.\r\n\r\nIn order for a browser to render a webpage correctly, it needs to have a valid HTML code. This means that the code must adhere to the rules and syntax defined by the HTML standard. Web developers use various tools and editors to create HTML code, such as Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, and Dreamweaver.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Understand the Basics\r\nHTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a language used to create web pages. It uses a series of tags to define and format content on a webpage. Before getting started, it's essential to understand the basics of HTML.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Create a New Document\r\nTo start creating an HTML document, you will need a text editor like Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code. Open your text editor and create a new file. Save the file with the extension \".html\" to indicate that it's an HTML document.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Define the Document Type\r\nAt the beginning of every HTML document, you should define the document type. This is done by adding the following line of code at the top of your document:\r\n\r\nphp\r\nCopy code\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\nThis tells the browser that this is an HTML5 document.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Create the HTML Skeleton\r\nNext, you need to create the HTML skeleton. This includes the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. The <html> tag should enclose the entire document, while the <head> tag should contain the document's metadata, such as the title and links to external stylesheets. The <body> tag should contain all the visible content on the webpage.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of what the HTML skeleton should look like:\r\n\r\nphp\r\nCopy code\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n   <head>\r\n      <title>My Webpage</title>\r\n   </head>\r\n   <body>\r\n      <!-- visible content goes here -->\r\n   </body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\nStep 5: Add Content to the Webpage\r\nNow it's time to add content to the webpage. You can use various HTML tags to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. Here are some examples:\r\n\r\nphp\r\nCopy code\r\n<!-- Heading -->\r\n<h1>This is a Heading</h1>\r\n\r\n<!-- Paragraph -->\r\n<p>This is a paragraph.</p>\r\n\r\n<!-- Link -->\r\n<a href=\"https://www.example.com\">Visit Example.com</a>\r\n\r\n<!-- Image -->\r\n<img src=\"image.jpg\" alt=\"An image\">\r\n\r\nStep 6: Save and Open the HTML File\r\nOnce you've added the content to the HTML file, save it and open it in a web browser. You should see the content you added displayed on the webpage.", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewZ_YWbIWXI&t=1s"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 306, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "CSS / Chakra", "description": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style web pages by describing how HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements should be displayed on the screen. CSS allows web designers and developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and modify the style of a web page without having to change its underlying HTML.\r\n\r\nChakra is a CSS-in-JS (JavaScript) library developed by Microsoft for building user interfaces in React. It provides a set of utility functions and components for styling React components with CSS-like syntax. Chakra also includes a design system with a set of pre-built components, such as buttons, inputs, and navigation bars, that can be easily customized with CSS.\r\n\r\nChakra uses the Emotion library under the hood to generate CSS styles based on the CSS-in-JS syntax. This allows developers to write CSS styles directly in JavaScript code, which can be more convenient and flexible than writing separate CSS files.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Install Chakra UI\r\n\r\nTo use Chakra UI, you need to install it first. You can install Chakra UI via npm or yarn by running the following command in your terminal:\r\n\r\nbash\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm install @chakra-ui/react\r\nor\r\n\r\nsql\r\nCopy code\r\nyarn add @chakra-ui/react\r\n\r\nStep 2: Import Chakra UI components\r\n\r\nAfter installing Chakra UI, you can start using its components in your React application. To import Chakra UI components, you need to add the following line of code to your React component:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\nimport { Box, Button, Input } from \"@chakra-ui/react\";\r\nThis imports the Box, Button, and Input components from Chakra UI.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Apply CSS styling\r\n\r\nTo apply CSS styling to Chakra UI components, you can use the style prop. The style prop is an object that contains CSS properties and their values.\r\n\r\nFor example, to apply a red background color to a Box component, you can add the following code to your React component:\r\n\r\nrust\r\nCopy code\r\n<Box style={{ backgroundColor: \"red\" }}>This is a red box</Box>\r\nSimilarly, to apply a blue color to a Button component, you can add the following code:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\n<Button style={{ color: \"blue\" }}>Click me</Button>\r\nStep 4: Use CSS classes\r\n\r\nAnother way to apply CSS styling to Chakra UI components is by using CSS classes. You can define CSS classes in your CSS file and then apply them to your Chakra UI components.\r\n\r\nTo apply a CSS class to a Box component, you can add the className prop to the component and set its value to the name of the CSS class:\r\n\r\nrust\r\nCopy code\r\n<Box className=\"red-box\">This is a red box</Box>\r\nIn your CSS file, you can define the red-box class as follows:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\n.red-box {\r\n  background-color: red;\r\n}\r\nSimilarly, to apply a CSS class to a Button component, you can add the className prop to the component and set its value to the name of the CSS class:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\n<Button className=\"blue-button\">Click me</Button>\r\nIn your CSS file, you can define the blue-button class as follows:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\n.blue-button {\r\n  color: blue;\r\n}\r\n\r\nStep 5: Use Chakra UI style props\r\n\r\nChakra UI provides a set of style props that you can use to apply styling to its components. These style props are similar to the regular HTML attributes, but they have a more concise syntax.\r\n\r\nFor example, to apply a red background color to a Box component using the bg style prop, you can add the following code:\r\n\r\nrust\r\nCopy code\r\n<Box bg=\"red\">This is a red box</Box>\r\nSimilarly, to apply a blue color to a Button component using the color style prop, you can add the following code:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\n<Button color=\"blue\">Click me</Button>\r\nChakra UI provides many more style props that you can use to apply different types of styling to its components.

You can download and install them from the official Node.js website.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Create a new Next.js app\r\nTo create a new Next.js app, open up a terminal window and run the following command:\r\n\r\nlua\r\nCopy code\r\nnpx create-next-app my-app\r\nReplace my-app with the name you want to give your application. This will create a new Next.js application in a folder with the same name.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Start the development server\r\nOnce the app is created, navigate into the app directory by running:\r\n\r\nbash\r\nCopy code\r\ncd my-app\r\nThen, start the development server by running:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\nnpm run dev\r\nThis will start a development server at http://localhost:3000. You should see the default Next.js homepage when you visit this URL in your browser.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Add a new page\r\nNext.js uses a file-based routing system. To add a new page to your app, create a new file in the pages directory. For example, to create a new /about page, create a file called about.js in the pages directory and add the following code:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfunction About() {\r\n  return <h1>About Page</h1>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default About;\r\nNext.js will automatically generate a route for this page based on the file name. In this case, the route will be /about.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Add some styles\r\nNext.js comes with built-in support for CSS and Sass. To add styles to your app, create a new file in the styles directory. For example, to add some global styles, create a file called globals.css in the styles directory and add the following code:\r\n\r\ncss\r\nCopy code\r\nbody {\r\n  margin: 0;\r\n  padding: 0;\r\n  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu,\r\n    Cantarell, Fira Sans, Droid Sans, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif;\r\n  -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;\r\n  -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;\r\n}\r\n\r\n* {\r\n  box-sizing: border-box;\r\n}\r\nThen, import this file into your app by adding the following line to the _app.js file:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\nimport '../styles/globals.css'\r\nStep 6: Add some components\r\nReact is all about building reusable components. To add a new component to your app, create a new file in the components directory. For example, to create a new Button component, create a file called Button.js in the components directory and add the following code:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfunction Button({ children }) {\r\n  return <button>{children}</button>;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Button;\r\nThen, use this component in your pages by importing it and rendering it like this:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nimport Button from '../components/Button';\r\n\r\nfunction HomePage() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div>\r\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\r\n      <Button>Click me</Button>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default HomePage;\r\nStep 7: Deploy your app\r\nOnce you're happy with your app, it's time to deploy it.

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that facilitate, verify, and enforce the terms of an agreement between parties without the need for intermediaries. Solidity is a popular language for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum network, as it allows developers to write efficient and secure smart contracts that can interact with other smart contracts and the blockchain itself.\r\n\r\nSolidity has a syntax similar to that of JavaScript, and it supports features like inheritance, libraries, and complex user-defined types. It also includes built-in security features to help prevent common programming errors and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Solidity code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Setup Environment\r\nTo get started with Solidity, you need to set up your development environment. Solidity requires a few dependencies to be installed like Node.js, npm, and a few other packages. You can follow the official Solidity documentation for the installation process.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Install an IDE\r\nTo write and compile Solidity smart contracts, you need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that supports Solidity. There are a few popular IDEs available for Solidity, such as Remix, Truffle, and Visual Studio Code.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Create a New Solidity File\r\nOnce you have an IDE installed, you can create a new Solidity file with a \".sol\" extension. This file will contain the code for your smart contract.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Write the Smart Contract\r\nNow, you can start writing your smart contract in the Solidity programming language. A smart contract in Solidity consists of several parts, including the contract definition, state variables, functions, and modifiers. You can refer to the official Solidity documentation for more details on each of these parts.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Compile the Smart Contract\r\nOnce you have written your smart contract, you need to compile it using a Solidity compiler. There are several Solidity compilers available, such as solc and Remix. The compiler will generate bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\r\n\r\nStep 6: Deploy the Smart Contract\r\nOnce you have compiled your smart contract, you need to deploy it to the Ethereum network. There are several ways to deploy a smart contract, including using Remix or deploying it programmatically using web3.js or another Ethereum client library.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Interact with the Smart Contract\r\nAfter you have deployed your smart contract, you can interact with it using an Ethereum wallet or an Ethereum client library. You can use these tools to call the functions defined in your smart contract and to read or modify its state variables.\r\n\r\nSolidity is a powerful programming language that enables you to create sophisticated smart contracts that can run on the Ethereum network. By following this step-by-step tutorial, you can start writing your own Solidity smart contracts and deploying them to the Ethereum network.\r\nWebsite link - https://soliditylang.org/", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdvVwGrV7ec"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 315, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Foundry", "description": "Foundry is a company that specializes in creating cutting-edge software for the creative industry, with the aim of advancing the visual experience of its users.

It also supports multiple blockchain networks, making it a versatile solution for connecting smart contracts to external data sources.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Install a Wallet\r\n\r\nThe first step is to install a wallet that is compatible with Chainlink. We recommend using either MetaMask or MyEtherWallet. You can download these wallets from their respective websites.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Buy Some Ethereum\r\n\r\nChainlink is built on the Ethereum blockchain, so you will need some Ethereum to interact with the network. You can buy Ethereum from a cryptocurrency exchange such as Coinbase, Binance, or Kraken.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Connect your Wallet to Chainlink\r\n\r\nOnce you have a wallet and some Ethereum, you will need to connect your wallet to the Chainlink network. To do this, you will need to add the Chainlink network to your wallet's list of networks.\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to add the Chainlink network to MetaMask:\r\n\r\nOpen the MetaMask wallet extension in your browser\r\nClick on the network dropdown in the top center of the screen\r\nClick on \"Custom RPC\" at the bottom of the network list\r\nEnter the following information:\r\nNetwork Name: Chainlink\r\nNew RPC URL: https://rpc.chain.link\r\nChain ID: 0x1 (or 1)\r\nSymbol: LINK\r\nBlock Explorer URL: https://etherscan.io/\r\nClick \"Save\"\r\nHere are the steps to add the Chainlink network to MyEtherWallet:\r\n\r\nGo to MyEtherWallet.com and click \"Access My Wallet\"\r\nChoose \"Network\" in the top right corner of the screen\r\nClick \"Add Custom Node\"\r\nEnter the following information:\r\nNode Name: Chainlink\r\nURL: https://rpc.chain.link\r\nPort: 443\r\nChain ID: 1\r\nSymbol: LINK\r\nBlock Explorer URL: https://etherscan.io/\r\nClick \"Save & Use Custom Node\"\r\n\r\nStep 4: Buy Some LINK Tokens\r\n\r\nChainlink's native token is LINK. You can buy LINK from a cryptocurrency exchange such as Binance, Kraken, or Coinbase.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Create a Chainlink Node\r\n\r\nTo become a node operator on the Chainlink network, you will need to set up a Chainlink node. This involves setting up a virtual machine and installing the Chainlink software. You can follow the instructions on the Chainlink website to set up a node.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Create a Smart Contract\r\n\r\nOnce you have a Chainlink node set up, you can create a smart contract that uses the Chainlink network to retrieve external data. To do this, you will need to write a smart contract in Solidity, the programming language used by Ethereum.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a smart contract that uses Chainlink to retrieve the current price of Bitcoin:\r\n\r\ntypescript\r\nCopy code\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/ChainlinkClient.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract BitcoinPrice is ChainlinkClient {\r\n    \r\n    uint256 public bitcoinPrice;\r\n    address private oracle;\r\n    bytes32 private jobId;\r\n    uint256 private fee;\r\n    \r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        setPublicChainlinkToken();\r\n        oracle = 0x7AFe1118Ea78C1eae84ca8feE5C65Bc76CcF879e;\r\n        jobId = \"29fa9aa13bf1468788b7cc4a500a45b8\";\r\n        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function request\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://chain.link/", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIUHQ7sDoaU"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 317, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "JavaScript", "description": "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is commonly used in web development. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, and has since become one of the most widely-used programming languages, powering many of the interactive features found on modern websites and web applications.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is a versatile language, allowing developers to create everything from simple scripts that enhance website functionality, to complex applications and games. It is used both on the front-end and back-end of web development, and can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic, interactive web pages.\r\n\r\nSome key features of JavaScript include its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events, and interact with APIs and server-side technologies. It is also a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can hold any type of value.\r\n\r\nJavaScript has a large and active community of developers, and is supported by many popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue. As the web continues to evolve and become more interactive, JavaScript will likely continue to play a major role in web development.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment\r\nThe first step to getting started with JavaScript is setting up your development environment. You'll need a code editor, a web browser, and a server to run your JavaScript code. You can use any text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Brackets. Also, you can use a web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Writing Your First JavaScript Code\r\nOnce you have your development environment set up, it's time to start writing your first JavaScript code. Open your code editor and create a new file with a .js extension. Then, start writing your code. For example, you can start with a simple \"Hello World\" program, like this:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\r\nThis code uses the console.log() method to print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Variables and Data Types\r\nVariables are used to store values in JavaScript. To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the keyword var, let, or const. Variables can hold various data types like numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nvar name = \"John\"; // string variable\r\nvar age = 25; // number variable\r\nvar isStudent = true; // boolean variable\r\nvar hobbies = [\"reading\", \"music\", \"travel\"]; // array variable\r\n\r\nStep 4: Conditional Statements\r\nConditional statements are used to execute different code blocks based on a condition. The if statement is the most common conditional statement in JavaScript.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nif (age >= 18) {\r\n  console.log(\"You are eligible to vote!\");\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(\"You are not eligible to vote yet!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis code checks if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it prints \"You are eligible to vote!\". Otherwise, it prints \"You are not eligible to vote yet!\".\r\n\r\nStep 5: Loops\r\nLoops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The for loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\r\n  console.log(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis code prints the numbers from 0 to 4 to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Functions\r\nFunctions are used to group a set of statements that perform a specific task. Functions can take parameters and return values.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfunction add(a, b) {\r\n  return a + b;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar result = add(5, 10);\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\nThis code defines a function called add that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum. It then calls the function with the values 5 and 10 and prints the result to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Objects and Classes\r\nObjects are used to group related variables and functions into a single entity. Classes are a way to define objects with a specific set of properties and methods.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nclass Person {\r\n  constructor(name, age) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n    this.age = age;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  greet() {\r\n    console.log(\"Hello, my name is \" + this.name + \" and I am \" + this.age + \" years old.\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar john = new Person(\"John\", 25);\r\njohn.greet();\r\nThis code defines a class called Person with a constructor that sets the name and age properties. It also defines a greet method that prints a message to the console. It then creates a\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://www.javascript.com/", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 318, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Go Storage", "description": "Go Storage is a self-storage company that offers storage solutions for both personal and business needs.

Their website offers a user-friendly interface for customers to reserve units online, pay bills, and manage their accounts. The company has multiple locations throughout the United States, making it a convenient storage solution for customers in various regions.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Choose a storage backend\r\n\r\nThe first step in building a Go storage system is to choose a storage backend. There are several popular storage backends to choose from, including local file systems, cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, and distributed file systems like HDFS. Depending on your requirements, you may choose one of these backends or a combination of them.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Install the required packages\r\n\r\nOnce you have chosen a storage backend, the next step is to install the required packages. Go has a built-in package management system called Go modules that makes it easy to install packages. To get started, create a new Go module by running the following command:\r\n\r\nswift\r\nCopy code\r\ngo mod init <module_name>\r\nThis will create a new Go module in the current directory with the specified module name. Once you have created the module, you can install the required packages by running the following command:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\ngo get <package_name>\r\nReplace <package_name> with the name of the package you want to install. For example, if you want to use Amazon S3 as your storage backend, you can install the AWS SDK for Go by running the following command:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\r\nStep 3: Create a storage client\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create a storage client that will interact with your storage backend. The client will handle all the interactions with the storage backend, such as uploading and downloading files. To create a storage client, you can create a new Go file in your project directory and add the following code:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"os\"\r\n\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\"\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\"\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    // Create a new AWS session\r\n    sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{\r\n        SharedConfigState: session.SharedConfigEnable,\r\n    }))\r\n\r\n    // Create an S3 client\r\n    svc := s3.New(sess)\r\n\r\n    // List all S3 buckets\r\n    result, err := svc.ListBuckets(nil)\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(\"Error listing buckets\", err)\r\n        os.Exit(1)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Print the bucket names\r\n    fmt.Println(\"Buckets:\")\r\n    for _, b := range result.Buckets {\r\n        fmt.Printf(\"* %s created on %s\\n\",\r\n            aws.StringValue(b.Name), aws.TimeValue(b.CreationDate))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThis code creates a new AWS session and an S3 client that you can use to interact with your S3 storage backend. It also lists all the S3 buckets and prints their names and creation dates.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Implement storage operations\r\n\r\nThe final step is to implement the storage operations that your application requires. These operations will depend on the specific requirements of your application, but some common operations include uploading and downloading files, creating and deleting directories, and listing the contents of a directory.\r\n\r\nHere is an example implementation of the Upload and Download methods:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\n// Upload uploads a file to the storage backend\r\nfunc Upload(bucket string, key string, filename string) error {\r\n    // Open the file to upload\r\n    file, err := os.Open(filename)\r\n    if\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://go-group.com/storage.html", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNOs3LlsH6k"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 324, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Project - Management Zenkit", "description": "Zenkit is a versatile and user-friendly productivity and collaboration tool designed to streamline tasks, projects, and data management.

Presets are commonly associated with settings or configurations that can be saved and reused for convenience in various applications, such as photo editing software, music production tools, or video editing programs. Here's a general description and a tutorial for using presets:\r\n\r\nPreset Description:\r\nA preset is a pre-configured set of parameters or settings that can be applied to achieve a specific result in a software application. It is essentially a saved configuration that allows users to easily replicate a desired look or functionality without manually adjusting individual settings. Presets are commonly used in creative applications to streamline workflows and maintain consistency.\r\n\r\nUsing Presets: A General Tutorial\r\nStep 1: Locate Preset Options\r\nOpen the Application:\r\n\r\nLaunch the application that supports presets. This could be a photo editing tool, audio software, or any other application with preset functionality.\r\nFind Preset Options:\r\n\r\nLocate the section or menu where presets are managed. This might be labeled as \"Presets,\" \"Styles,\" or something similar.\r\nStep 2: Choose or Create a Preset\r\nBrowse Existing Presets:\r\n\r\nIf the application comes with pre-installed presets, browse through them to find a style or configuration that suits your needs.\r\nCreate Your Own:\r\n\r\nSome applications allow you to create custom presets. Adjust the settings to achieve the desired look or functionality, then save these settings as a new preset.\r\nStep 3: Apply the Preset\r\nApply Preset:\r\nOnce you've chosen or created a preset, apply it to your current project or file. This usually involves selecting the preset from a menu or applying it with a single click.\r\nStep 4: Fine-Tune if Necessary\r\nAdjust Settings (Optional):\r\nEven after applying a preset, you may want to fine-tune specific settings to better match your requirements. Most presets are customizable, allowing you to make additional adjustments.\r\nStep 5: Save or Share Presets\r\nSave Custom Presets:\r\n\r\nIf you've created a custom preset, save it for future use. This ensures that you can easily reproduce the same style or configuration in other projects.\r\nShare Presets (Optional):\r\n\r\nSome applications allow you to share presets with others. If collaboration is a part of your workflow, explore options for exporting and sharing presets.\r\nAdditional Tips:\r\nExplore Preset Libraries:\r\n\r\nSome applications have online libraries where users can share and download presets. Explore these libraries to discover new and creative presets.\r\nBackup Presets:\r\n\r\nIf your application allows, regularly back up your custom presets to prevent loss in case of software updates or system changes", "ad": "dd", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/@WebflippyOfficialPage"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 380, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Obsidian(Productivity)", "description": "Obsidian is a versatile productivity tool that leverages the power of knowledge graphs and note-taking.

You can download the plugin as a zip file and extract it to your local machine.\r\n\r\n2. Once you have downloaded and extracted the plugin files, you will need to include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your web page. You can do this by adding the following lines to the head section of your HTML document:\r\n\r\nhtml\r\nCopy code\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"path/to/modaal.min.css\">\r\n<script src=\"path/to/jquery.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"path/to/modaal.min.js\"></script>\r\nMake sure to replace the \"path/to/\" part with the actual path to the plugin files on your server.\r\n\r\n3. Next, you will need to add some HTML markup for your dialog window. Here is a basic example:\r\nhtml\r\nCopy code\r\n<a href=\"#myModal\" class=\"modal\">Open Modal</a>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"myModal\" class=\"modal-content\">\r\n  <h2>Modal Title</h2>\r\n  <p>Modal content goes here.</p>\r\n</div>\r\nIn this example, we have a link with the class \"modal\" that will trigger the dialog window when clicked. The dialog window itself is defined by a div element with the ID \"myModal\" and the class \"modal-content\". You can customize the contents of the dialog window as needed.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, you will need to initialize the Modaal plugin on your dialog window. You can do this by adding the following JavaScript code to your web page:\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n  $('.modal').modaal({\r\n    content_source: '#myModal'\r\n  });\r\n});\r\nThis code will initialize the Modaal plugin on all links with the class \"modal\". When the link is clicked, the plugin will open the dialog window defined by the div element with the ID \"myModal\".\r\n\r\nThat's it! With these four steps, you should now have a basic dialog window up and running on your website using the Modaal plugin. You can customize the appearance and behavior of the dialog window by exploring the plugin documentation and experimenting with the various options and settings.", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dp3a5jMCBCY", "website_link": "https://www.humaan.com/modaal/"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 236, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Canva", "description": "Canva is a popular online graphic design platform that allows users to create professional-looking designs for various purposes.

You can follow the instructions on the Chainlink website to set up a node.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Create a Smart Contract\r\n\r\nOnce you have a Chainlink node set up, you can create a smart contract that uses the Chainlink network to retrieve external data. To do this, you will need to write a smart contract in Solidity, the programming language used by Ethereum.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a smart contract that uses Chainlink to retrieve the current price of Bitcoin:\r\n\r\ntypescript\r\nCopy code\r\npragma solidity ^0.6.0;\r\n\r\nimport \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.6/ChainlinkClient.sol\";\r\n\r\ncontract BitcoinPrice is ChainlinkClient {\r\n    \r\n    uint256 public bitcoinPrice;\r\n    address private oracle;\r\n    bytes32 private jobId;\r\n    uint256 private fee;\r\n    \r\n    constructor() public {\r\n        setPublicChainlinkToken();\r\n        oracle = 0x7AFe1118Ea78C1eae84ca8feE5C65Bc76CcF879e;\r\n        jobId = \"29fa9aa13bf1468788b7cc4a500a45b8\";\r\n        fee = 0.1 * 10 ** 18; // 0.1 LINK\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function request\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://chain.link/", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIUHQ7sDoaU", "website_link": "https://chain.link/"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 317, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "JavaScript", "description": "JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is commonly used in web development. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, and has since become one of the most widely-used programming languages, powering many of the interactive features found on modern websites and web applications.\r\n\r\nJavaScript is a versatile language, allowing developers to create everything from simple scripts that enhance website functionality, to complex applications and games. It is used both on the front-end and back-end of web development, and can interact with HTML and CSS to create dynamic, interactive web pages.\r\n\r\nSome key features of JavaScript include its ability to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user events, and interact with APIs and server-side technologies. It is also a dynamically-typed language, which means that variables can hold any type of value.\r\n\r\nJavaScript has a large and active community of developers, and is supported by many popular libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue. As the web continues to evolve and become more interactive, JavaScript will likely continue to play a major role in web development.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Setting up the Development Environment\r\nThe first step to getting started with JavaScript is setting up your development environment. You'll need a code editor, a web browser, and a server to run your JavaScript code. You can use any text editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, or Brackets. Also, you can use a web browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Writing Your First JavaScript Code\r\nOnce you have your development environment set up, it's time to start writing your first JavaScript code. Open your code editor and create a new file with a .js extension. Then, start writing your code. For example, you can start with a simple \"Hello World\" program, like this:\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nconsole.log(\"Hello, World!\");\r\nThis code uses the console.log() method to print \"Hello, World!\" to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Variables and Data Types\r\nVariables are used to store values in JavaScript. To declare a variable in JavaScript, you can use the keyword var, let, or const. Variables can hold various data types like numbers, strings, booleans, objects, and arrays.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nvar name = \"John\"; // string variable\r\nvar age = 25; // number variable\r\nvar isStudent = true; // boolean variable\r\nvar hobbies = [\"reading\", \"music\", \"travel\"]; // array variable\r\n\r\nStep 4: Conditional Statements\r\nConditional statements are used to execute different code blocks based on a condition. The if statement is the most common conditional statement in JavaScript.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nif (age >= 18) {\r\n  console.log(\"You are eligible to vote!\");\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(\"You are not eligible to vote yet!\");\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis code checks if the variable age is greater than or equal to 18. If the condition is true, it prints \"You are eligible to vote!\". Otherwise, it prints \"You are not eligible to vote yet!\".\r\n\r\nStep 5: Loops\r\nLoops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. The for loop is the most commonly used loop in JavaScript.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\r\n  console.log(i);\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis code prints the numbers from 0 to 4 to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Functions\r\nFunctions are used to group a set of statements that perform a specific task. Functions can take parameters and return values.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nfunction add(a, b) {\r\n  return a + b;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar result = add(5, 10);\r\nconsole.log(result);\r\nThis code defines a function called add that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum. It then calls the function with the values 5 and 10 and prints the result to the console.\r\n\r\nStep 7: Objects and Classes\r\nObjects are used to group related variables and functions into a single entity. Classes are a way to define objects with a specific set of properties and methods.\r\n\r\njavascript\r\nCopy code\r\nclass Person {\r\n  constructor(name, age) {\r\n    this.name = name;\r\n    this.age = age;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  greet() {\r\n    console.log(\"Hello, my name is \" + this.name + \" and I am \" + this.age + \" years old.\");\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar john = new Person(\"John\", 25);\r\njohn.greet();\r\nThis code defines a class called Person with a constructor that sets the name and age properties. It also defines a greet method that prints a message to the console. It then creates a\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://www.javascript.com/", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4", "website_link": "https://ke.izito.com/ws?q=how%20to%20code%20an%20app&asid=izx_ke_gc1_01&mt=b&nw=g&de=c&ap=&ac=25742&cid=16400021174&aid=134621340635&locale=en_KE&ch=1737&gclid=CjwKCAiApuCrBhAuEiwA8VJ6Jsi2mmc7LNQAx0Kr"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 318, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Go Storage", "description": "Go Storage is a self-storage company that offers storage solutions for both personal and business needs. The company provides a range of storage unit sizes, from small lockers to large rooms, that are accessible 24/7 with secure access controls. Their facilities are equipped with state-of-the-art security features, such as video surveillance, individual unit alarms, and secure locks.\r\n\r\nIn addition to traditional self-storage options, Go Storage also offers climate-controlled units for items that require a specific temperature range, as well as outdoor parking spaces for vehicles and RVs.

Their website offers a user-friendly interface for customers to reserve units online, pay bills, and manage their accounts. The company has multiple locations throughout the United States, making it a convenient storage solution for customers in various regions.", "tutorial_tool": "Step 1: Choose a storage backend\r\n\r\nThe first step in building a Go storage system is to choose a storage backend. There are several popular storage backends to choose from, including local file systems, cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3, and distributed file systems like HDFS. Depending on your requirements, you may choose one of these backends or a combination of them.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Install the required packages\r\n\r\nOnce you have chosen a storage backend, the next step is to install the required packages. Go has a built-in package management system called Go modules that makes it easy to install packages. To get started, create a new Go module by running the following command:\r\n\r\nswift\r\nCopy code\r\ngo mod init <module_name>\r\nThis will create a new Go module in the current directory with the specified module name. Once you have created the module, you can install the required packages by running the following command:\r\n\r\narduino\r\nCopy code\r\ngo get <package_name>\r\nReplace <package_name> with the name of the package you want to install. For example, if you want to use Amazon S3 as your storage backend, you can install the AWS SDK for Go by running the following command:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\r\ngo get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\r\nStep 3: Create a storage client\r\n\r\nThe next step is to create a storage client that will interact with your storage backend. The client will handle all the interactions with the storage backend, such as uploading and downloading files. To create a storage client, you can create a new Go file in your project directory and add the following code:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n    \"fmt\"\r\n    \"os\"\r\n\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws\"\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session\"\r\n    \"github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/s3\"\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    // Create a new AWS session\r\n    sess := session.Must(session.NewSessionWithOptions(session.Options{\r\n        SharedConfigState: session.SharedConfigEnable,\r\n    }))\r\n\r\n    // Create an S3 client\r\n    svc := s3.New(sess)\r\n\r\n    // List all S3 buckets\r\n    result, err := svc.ListBuckets(nil)\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(\"Error listing buckets\", err)\r\n        os.Exit(1)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Print the bucket names\r\n    fmt.Println(\"Buckets:\")\r\n    for _, b := range result.Buckets {\r\n        fmt.Printf(\"* %s created on %s\\n\",\r\n            aws.StringValue(b.Name), aws.TimeValue(b.CreationDate))\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nThis code creates a new AWS session and an S3 client that you can use to interact with your S3 storage backend. It also lists all the S3 buckets and prints their names and creation dates.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Implement storage operations\r\n\r\nThe final step is to implement the storage operations that your application requires. These operations will depend on the specific requirements of your application, but some common operations include uploading and downloading files, creating and deleting directories, and listing the contents of a directory.\r\n\r\nHere is an example implementation of the Upload and Download methods:\r\n\r\ngo\r\nCopy code\r\n// Upload uploads a file to the storage backend\r\nfunc Upload(bucket string, key string, filename string) error {\r\n    // Open the file to upload\r\n    file, err := os.Open(filename)\r\n    if\r\n\r\nWebsite link - https://go-group.com/storage.html", "ad": "", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNOs3LlsH6k", "website_link": "https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go/storage"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 324, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Project - Management Zenkit", "description": "Zenkit is a versatile and user-friendly productivity and collaboration tool designed to streamline tasks, projects, and data management.

Presets are commonly associated with settings or configurations that can be saved and reused for convenience in various applications, such as photo editing software, music production tools, or video editing programs. Here's a general description and a tutorial for using presets:\r\n\r\nPreset Description:\r\nA preset is a pre-configured set of parameters or settings that can be applied to achieve a specific result in a software application. It is essentially a saved configuration that allows users to easily replicate a desired look or functionality without manually adjusting individual settings. Presets are commonly used in creative applications to streamline workflows and maintain consistency.\r\n\r\nUsing Presets: A General Tutorial\r\nStep 1: Locate Preset Options\r\nOpen the Application:\r\n\r\nLaunch the application that supports presets. This could be a photo editing tool, audio software, or any other application with preset functionality.\r\nFind Preset Options:\r\n\r\nLocate the section or menu where presets are managed. This might be labeled as \"Presets,\" \"Styles,\" or something similar.\r\nStep 2: Choose or Create a Preset\r\nBrowse Existing Presets:\r\n\r\nIf the application comes with pre-installed presets, browse through them to find a style or configuration that suits your needs.\r\nCreate Your Own:\r\n\r\nSome applications allow you to create custom presets. Adjust the settings to achieve the desired look or functionality, then save these settings as a new preset.\r\nStep 3: Apply the Preset\r\nApply Preset:\r\nOnce you've chosen or created a preset, apply it to your current project or file. This usually involves selecting the preset from a menu or applying it with a single click.\r\nStep 4: Fine-Tune if Necessary\r\nAdjust Settings (Optional):\r\nEven after applying a preset, you may want to fine-tune specific settings to better match your requirements. Most presets are customizable, allowing you to make additional adjustments.\r\nStep 5: Save or Share Presets\r\nSave Custom Presets:\r\n\r\nIf you've created a custom preset, save it for future use. This ensures that you can easily reproduce the same style or configuration in other projects.\r\nShare Presets (Optional):\r\n\r\nSome applications allow you to share presets with others. If collaboration is a part of your workflow, explore options for exporting and sharing presets.\r\nAdditional Tips:\r\nExplore Preset Libraries:\r\n\r\nSome applications have online libraries where users can share and download presets. Explore these libraries to discover new and creative presets.\r\nBackup Presets:\r\n\r\nIf your application allows, regularly back up your custom presets to prevent loss in case of software updates or system changes", "ad": "dd", "youtube_link": "https://www.youtube.com/@WebflippyOfficialPage", "website_link": "https://preset.io/"}}, {"model": "Oduor.stuffs", "pk": 380, "fields": {"name_of_tool": "Obsidian(Productivity)", "description": "Obsidian is a versatile productivity tool that leverages the power of knowledge graphs and note-taking.
